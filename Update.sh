# Today I am learning about Github workflows and branches
#Today I learned how to create a branch, edit and commit changes in that branch, open a pull request, and merge the pull request into the main project
# Today I completed both parts of the final project on Getting Started with Git and Github provided by IBM. 
# As part of the project, I created an open source project in Git, made changes to that project and made it available to the community. 
# I forked a GitHub repository, cloned that repository to my local system, made changes to the local repository and committed the changes locally
# Finally I pushed the commits it back to my GitHub fork, and create a pull request to add your update to the original repository.
